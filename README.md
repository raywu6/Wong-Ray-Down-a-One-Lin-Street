## Overview
Actavius combines all of the services that a student uses to keep track of their college application activities, such that it is accessible all on one website. In addition to exploring different colleges and looking up details about universities, the user is able to keep track of where they are on a timeline with the help of a To-do list that is populated with deadlines. There is a financial aid page which will allow the user to calculate how much money they might need to spend on a college as well.
